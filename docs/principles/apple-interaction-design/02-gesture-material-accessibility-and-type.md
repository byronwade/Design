## 10. Gesture design details (the "feel" checklist)

- **Tap:** highlight on touch-*down* (instant), commit on touch-*up*. Add ~10px of hysteresis/hit padding around the target, and allow cancel-by-dragging-away and back.
- **Drag/swipe:** require a small movement threshold (hysteresis, ~10px) before committing to a direction, then track 1:1.
- **Detect all plausible gestures in parallel from the first move**, then confidently cancel the losers once intent is clear. Avoid recognizers that only report a *final* state (`swipeleft`-type events) — they throw away the continuous tracking you need for feedback.
- **Minimize disambiguation delays.** Double-tap detection unavoidably delays single taps; only pay that cost where double-tap truly exists.

## 11. Frame-level smoothness

Smoothness is about *what's in the frames*, not just the frame rate.

- Keep the per-frame positional change below the perception threshold to avoid strobing.
- For very fast motion, a subtle **motion blur / stretch** encodes speed and reads better than a hard sharp streak.
- `requestAnimationFrame` is the web's display-synced clock (Apple uses `CADisplayLink`). Animate only compositor-friendly properties — `transform` and `opacity` — and hint with `will-change` where motion is imminent.

## 12. Materials & depth — translucency conveys hierarchy

Apple uses translucent materials as a floating functional layer that brings structure without stealing focus. On the web, approximate with `backdrop-filter`.

- **Build nav/toolbars/sheets as translucent layers** (`backdrop-filter: blur()` + a semi-transparent background) with content scrolling underneath — not opaque bars that consume a fixed strip.
- **Material weight encodes hierarchy:** darker/heavier materials separate structural regions (sidebars); lighter materials draw attention to interactive elements (buttons). **Never stack a light translucent surface on another** — legibility collapses.
- **Bigger surfaces should read as thicker:** stronger blur + a deeper shadow than small chips. Consider context-aware shadow — heavier over busy/text content for separation, lighter over plain backgrounds.
- **Dim to focus, separate to keep flow.** A modal task pairs the surface with a dimming scrim and pushes the background back/down. A parallel, non-blocking panel uses translucency and offset *without* a scrim so the flow isn't broken. For stacked sheets, progressively dim and push back each parent layer.
- **Vibrancy keeps text legible over changing backgrounds.** Over blurred/translucent surfaces, don't use flat gray text — use higher-contrast, slightly heavier weight, and a small letter-spacing bump. Put color on a solid layer, not the translucent foreground.
- **Scroll edge effects, not hard dividers.** Instead of a 1px border under a sticky header, fade a small blur/gradient mask where content meets floating chrome — only where floating UI actually overlaps content.
- **Materialize, don't just fade.** For glass/blur surfaces, animate blur radius and scale together on enter/exit, so the surface reads as a real material arriving rather than a plain opacity fade.

```css
.toolbar {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(20px) saturate(180%);
  border-top: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.4); /* bright top edge = light catching the material */
}
```

## 13. Multimodal feedback — motion + sound + haptics

Three rules for combining senses (from *Designing Audio-Haptic Experiences*):

1. **Causality** — it must be obvious what caused the feedback. Trigger it on the actual causal event (the toggle flipping, the item snapping home), and match its character to the action's physicality.
2. **Harmony** — the visual, the sound, and the haptic must fire on the **same frame**. Latency between them destroys the illusion. Don't let a CSS transition lag the audio/haptic (Vibration API).
3. **Utility** — add feedback only where it earns its place. Reserve haptics/sound for meaningful moments (success, error, commit, snap). Over-feedback trains users to ignore all of it.

## 14. Reduced motion & accessibility

Reduced motion doesn't mean *no* feedback — it means a gentler, non-vestibular equivalent. Respond to three independent signals and bake them into your components:

- **`prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`** — replace slides/springs/parallax with short opacity **cross-fades or static transitions**. Drop elastic/overshoot. Keep opacity/color changes that aid comprehension.
- **`prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce`** — make translucent surfaces frostier/solid: raise background opacity, drop the blur.
- **`prefers-contrast: more`** — near-solid backgrounds with a defined, contrasting border.

Also: avoid full-viewport moving backgrounds, slow looping oscillations (near 0.2 Hz / one cycle per 5s), and abrupt brightness jumps (ease dark↔light theme changes). Make large moving objects semi-transparent while they travel, and fade big surfaces out during a large reposition and back in once settled.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .sheet { transition: opacity 200ms ease; transform: none !important; }
}
@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce) {
  .toolbar { background: white; backdrop-filter: none; }
}
```

## 15. Typography — optical sizing, tracking, leading

Apple designs type to change shape with size; the same discipline applies on the web. (From *The Details of UI Typography*, WWDC 2020.)

- **Tracking (letter-spacing) is size-specific — never one value for all sizes.** Large display text wants *negative* tracking (letters read too far apart as they grow); small text wants slightly *positive* tracking for legibility. A fixed `letter-spacing` is wrong somewhere. Tighten headings, leave body near `0`.
- **Leading (line-height) tracks size inversely.** Tight on large headings, looser on body copy. Increase it for scripts with tall ascenders/descenders; tighten it for dense, information-heavy UI.
- **Build hierarchy from weight + size + leading as a set,** not size alone. Emphasize with weight — it adds presence without taking more space.
- **Respect the user's text-size setting** (Dynamic Type). Scale layout *with* the text — spacing in `rem`/`em`, not fixed px — so a larger font doesn't break the layout.
- **Default to the platform's system font** before a custom face; it already ships optical sizing, tracking tables, and legibility tuning. Override only with a reason.

```css
:root { font: 100%/1.5 system-ui, sans-serif; } /* body: system font, comfortable leading */

.display {
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
  line-height: 1.05;        /* tight leading for large text */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em;  /* negative tracking as it grows */
  font-optical-sizing: auto;
}
```
